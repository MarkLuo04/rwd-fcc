            <p>Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase over time.
                Unlike centralized systems, Git allows each user to have a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work
                and better redundancy.</p>
            <p>GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It provides hosting for repositories, along with
                collaborative features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project boards. Developers use GitHub to share
                their code, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with team members.</p>
            <p>Version control helps developers manage project history, experiment safely through branches, and work with others
                without overwriting each other’s work. It’s a core tool for modern software development, essential for both solo
                projects and large-scale team collaborations.</p>

                <h2>Git Configuration and Setup</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Before you start using Git, it’s important to configure your identity and set up basic settings. This ensures
                that your commits are properly attributed and that you can connect to remote repositories securely.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code>: Sets your name in all commits.</li>
                <li><code>git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</code>: Sets your email in all commits.</li>
                <li><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"</code>: Generates an SSH key for secure GitHub
                    authentication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also configure other settings like line endings or set up handy aliases to simplify common commands.</p>

                <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Before working with Git, you need to understand some foundational commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git init</code>: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory, creating a .git folder
                    that tracks all changes.</li>
                <li><code>git status</code>: Shows the current state of your working directory, including changes staged for
                    commit or untracked files.</li>
                <li><code>git add</code>: Stages changes, telling Git which modifications you want to include in your next
                    commit.</li>
                <li><code>git commit</code>: Saves a snapshot of the staged changes, recording them permanently in the project
                    history with a commit message.</li>
                <li><code>git log</code>: Shows a list of past commits, helping you trace the project’s evolution and review
                    past changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These commands are the backbone of Git workflows and form the foundation for more advanced operations.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Using_.gitignore">
            <header>
                <h2>Using .gitignore</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The <code>.gitignore</code> file tells Git which files or directories to ignore. This is useful for excluding
                temporary files, logs, or system-generated content that shouldn’t be tracked in the repository.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common entries include <code>node_modules/</code> for Node.js projects or <code>*.log</code> for log files.
                </li>
                <li>Edit the <code>.gitignore</code> file in the root of your repository and add paths or patterns.</li>
                <li>If you accidentally tracked a file before adding it to <code>.gitignore</code>, remove it with
                    <code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keeping your repository clean and focused helps avoid bloating it with unnecessary files.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Branching_and_Merging">
            <header>
                <h2>Branching and Merging</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without disturbing the main codebase.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git branch</code>: Lists all branches or creates a new one.</li>
                <li><code>git checkout</code>: Switches between branches so you can work on multiple tasks in parallel.</li>
                <li><code>git merge</code>: Brings changes from one branch into another (usually into main or master).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Branching is powerful because it enables safe experimentation — if something breaks, the main line of development
                remains stable. Just remember to regularly merge and resolve conflicts to keep branches from diverging too far.

            <header>
                <h2>Working with Remotes</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A remote repository (like on GitHub) lets you share your code with others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git remote add</code>: Links your local repository to a GitHub repository.</li>
                <li><code>git push</code>: Uploads your commits to the remote.</li>
                <li><code>git pull</code>: Fetches the latest changes and merges them into your local branch.</li>
                <li><code>git fetch</code>: Retrieves updates without merging, letting you review them first.</li>
                <li><code>git clone</code>: Makes a full copy of a remote repository onto your local machine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using remotes ensures that your work stays backed up and synchronized with the team’s collective progress.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Resolving_Merge_Conflicts">
            <header>
                <h2>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically reconcile changes between branches. This usually happens when
                two branches modify the same lines in a file.</p>
            <p>To resolve a merge conflict:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open the conflicting files and edit them to combine the changes.</li>
                <li>After fixing, use <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> to mark the conflict as resolved.</li>
                <li>Finally, use <code>git commit</code> to complete the merge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To avoid frequent conflicts, communicate with your team, pull regularly, and keep branches short-lived.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Pull_Requests_and_Collaboration">
            <header>
                <h2>Pull Requests and Collaboration</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Pull requests (PRs) are a collaboration feature on GitHub that let you propose changes to a repository.</p>
            <p>After pushing your branch to GitHub, you can open a pull request to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Show others the changes you’ve made</li>
                <li>Request feedback or reviews</li>
                <li>Start a discussion about the modifications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other contributors can comment, suggest improvements, or approve the PR. Once approved, the changes can be merged
                into the main branch.</p>
            <p>Best practices include writing clear, descriptive PR titles, linking relevant issues, and being responsive to
                requested changes. Pull requests help maintain code quality and ensure that all changes are reviewed before
                being integrated.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Git_Revert_and_Reset">
            <header>
                <h2>Git Revert and Reset</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Sometimes you need to undo changes. Git offers two main ways: <code>git revert</code> and <code>git reset</code>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git revert &lt;commit&gt;</code>: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.
                    This is a safe option because it preserves project history.</li>
                <li><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;</code>: Resets your repository to a specific commit, discarding all
                    commits and changes after it. Use this carefully, as it can permanently remove work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding when to use revert vs. reset helps you recover gracefully from mistakes.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Git_Tags_and_Releases">
            <header>
                <h2>Git Tags and Releases</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Tags are used to mark specific points in your commit history, often to label releases or important milestones.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git tag v1.0.0</code>: Creates a new tag called <code>v1.0.0</code> on your current commit.</li>
                <li><code>git push origin v1.0.0</code>: Pushes the tag to the remote repository so others can see it.</li>
                <li>On GitHub, you can also create releases linked to tags, adding release notes and downloadable assets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tags and releases help teams coordinate and communicate about stable versions of their projects.</p>
